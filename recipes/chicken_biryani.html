    <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Pakistani-style Chicken Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish made by 
                layering spiced chicken with aromatic basmati rice. It's a perfect combination 
                of juicy, marinated chicken and fluffy, fragrant rice, often served on special 
                occasions and family gatherings. Infused with spices, herbs, and saffron, this 
                dish offers a rich blend of textures and flavors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The recipe begins by marinating chicken in a mixture of yogurt, spices, and herbs,
                which enhances its flavor and tenderness. Separately, basmati rice is partially 
                cooked with whole spices like cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon, infusing it with a 
                delicate aroma. The marinated chicken is then cooked with onions, tomatoes, and 
                green chilies until tender, creating a rich, flavorful gravy. The final step involves 
                layering the cooked chicken and rice in a pot, topped with fresh herbs, fried onions, 
                and saffron-infused milk. The biryani is then slow-cooked on low heat (dum style), 
                allowing the flavors to meld together and the rice to absorb the spices, resulting 
                in a deliciously fragrant and perfectly spiced dish.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Marinate the Chicken:</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, 
                        ginger paste, garlic paste, red chili powder,
                         turmeric, cumin powder, coriander powder, green chilies,
                          garam masala, lemon juice, and salt.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, 
                        coat them well, and let it marinate for at 
                        least 30 minutes (you can marinate for up to 
                        2 hours for better flavor).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li><h3>Cook the Rice:</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In a large pot, bring water to a boil. 
                        Add green cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, 
                        bay leaves, cumin seeds, and salt.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the soaked basmati rice and cook until 
                        the rice is 70-80% cooked (the grains should 
                        still have a bite to them).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Drain the rice and set it aside.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <li><h3>Cook the Chicken:</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In a large pan, heat the oil or ghee. 
                        Add sliced onions and fry until golden brown.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the marinated chicken and cook until
                        the chicken changes color and the masala releases oil.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add chopped tomatoes, cumin seeds, biryani masala, 
                        and whole green chilies. Cook until the tomatoes 
                        soften and the chicken is cooked through (about 10-15 minutes).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
            <li><h3>Layer the Biryani:</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In a large pot, start layering the biryani. 
                        First, add a layer of cooked chicken, then a layer of rice. 
                        Sprinkle chopped coriander, mint leaves, and fried onions over the rice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Drizzle the saffron milk on top and add a few lemon slices if desired.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repeat the layering process if you have more chicken and rice.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
            <li><h3>Dum Cooking:</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. 
                        If your lid isn't tight enough, place a clean 
                        kitchen towel over the pot before covering with the lid.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cook on low heat (you can also place a griddle or tawa under the pot) 
                        for 20-25 minutes. This step allows the flavors to meld together.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
            <li><h3>Serve:</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once done, gently mix the layers of chicken and rice before serving.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with fried onions and fresh coriander.</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
